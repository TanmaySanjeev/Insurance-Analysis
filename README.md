# Insurance-Analysis
Predict health expenses (in dollars, continuous target variable for regression problem) from basic personal characteristics of insured people.
Performance of initial data exploration, preparing and reporting all interesting and relevant finds which guide us for initiatives for the construction of our model.

The presentation of data (via a textual description, tables, and plots) is short and informative.

On this project we compare and show correct application of model selection methodologies and performance of the model.

In our model we will deal with hyperparameters, explaining on the model selection procedure how we took them into account, and trying a few possible values for them.

The hyperparameter selection and model training is based on regular computing resources, but it can be expanded, especially for hyperparameter tuning, "as if" you we access to a large computational infrastructure.

The regression metric used on this model is the MSE (Mean Squared Errors) and residual plots visuals.
